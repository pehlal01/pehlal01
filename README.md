Hello, my name is Alex and I'm currently getting my Masters in Analytics through Georgia Tech. I'm improving my analytic knowledge and skills;
including R, Python, and Python Packages (Pandas, numpy) plus picking up new software and tools in each class. 

Due to the nature of being a full time grad student and father, I've put personal projects on hold. However, I have done a lot of work in class and am happy to share it with
potential employees.
